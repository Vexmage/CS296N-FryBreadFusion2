<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to FrybreadFusion's Privacy Policy. Your privacy is critically important to us. This policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We only collect information that is necessary for the proper functioning of our website, and we do not share your personal information with third parties, except where required by law.</p>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, FrybreadFusion collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>FrybreadFusion discloses potentially personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that need to know that information in order to process it on FrybreadFusion's behalf. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using FrybreadFusion's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. FrybreadFusion uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of the website, and their website access preferences. FrybreadFusion visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using FrybreadFusion's website.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, FrybreadFusion may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
